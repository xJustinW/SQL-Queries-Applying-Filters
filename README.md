<h1>SQL: Queries and Filters</h1>

<b>In today's cyber world, SQL is vital for cybersecurity professionals. SQL (Structured Query Language) is essential due to its role in managing and querying databases, which are primary targets for cyberattacks. Moreover, SQL proficiency is crucial for defending against SQL injection attacks, a common and damaging technique used by hackers to manipulate databases and extract sensitive information. In this project, I work on applying filters to my SQL queries to navigate through a database and retrieve specific information such as login attempts in various different fashions.</b>
